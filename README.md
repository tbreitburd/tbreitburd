Hi! I'm Thomas Breitburd

I have studied Meteorology & Climate at the University of Reading (UK) for 4 years with a year in the US at the University of Oklahoma (an equally brilliant place for weather). It's an amazing field of science, and it is still relatively yound (200 years) so there are still a lot of unexplored and not well known phenomena that need understanding.

It's become clear to me a lot of the exciting progress and improvements that are being made currently are done through Machine Learning, AI and ingenious use of data. This is why I am currently completing the Mphil in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge.

Here in this repository are some of the coding projects I've had fun working on!
